        <h1>Hi, I’m Ziyanda</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Quality Assurance Engineer with hands-on experience testing real-world systems
            in a production environment. My foundation is in manual testing, where I developed
            a strong understanding of system behaviour, user workflows, and quality risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently work in a QA role at Delek Homes, where quality is not theoretical —
            it directly impacts business operations. This experience has shaped how I think
            about testing, responsibility, and reliability.

    <h2>My QA Journey</h2>

    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="item">
            <span>2022 — Advanced AI Trainer at Invisible Technologies</span>
            <p>
                I began my professional career in 2022 as an Advanced AI Trainer at Invisible
                Technologies. In this role, I was responsible for evaluating AI-generated outputs,
                identifying inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and edge cases, and ensuring responses
                met strict quality and accuracy standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                This work required deep attention to detail, analytical thinking, and the ability
                to assess system behaviour against defined expectations. Over time, I became
                increasingly interested in how complex systems fail, how quality can be measured,
                and how defects can be prevented rather than corrected later.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="item">
            <span>Transition — Developing a Strong Interest in Quality Assurance</span>
            <p>
                While working with AI systems, I realised that the aspects of my role I enjoyed most
                closely aligned with software testing: analysing behaviour, validating outcomes,
                questioning assumptions, and thinking through failure scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                This led me to explore Quality Assurance as a discipline where structured testing,
                clear defect reporting, and collaboration directly contribute to reliable and
                user-focused software.
            </p>

        <div class="item">
            <span>2025 — Manual QA Engineer at Delek Homes</span>
            <p>
                In 2025, I formally transitioned into a QA Engineer role at Delek Homes, working on
                internal systems that support real estate operations. My responsibilities included
                analysing requirements, designing and executing manual test cases, and performing
                functional, regression, and exploratory testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was accountable for logging clear, reproducible defects, retesting fixes, and
                confirming release readiness in collaboration with business stakeholders. This role
                strengthened my understanding of accountability, risk-based testing, and the real
                business impact of software quality.

        <div class="item">
            <span>2026 — ISTQB Certification & Automation Focus</span>
            <p>
                In 2026, I strengthened my theoretical foundation by obtaining the
                <strong>ISTQB Foundation Level certification</strong>, reinforcing my understanding
                of testing principles, test design techniques, defect management, and the software
                testing lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside this, I began transitioning into automation testing with a clear focus on
                understanding where automation adds value and how it can support strong manual
                testing practices rather than replace them.

                <h3>Think in Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    I approach testing by first understanding how a system fits into the wider
                    business process. This helps me identify integration points, dependencies,
                    and areas where failures would be most costly.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Test With Intent</h3>
                <p>
                    I do not treat test cases as checklists. Each test exists to answer a specific
                    risk-related question about the system, its users, or its data.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Learn From Outcomes</h3>
                <p>
                    I reflect on escaped defects, late discoveries, and feedback from releases
                    to continuously improve how I design and execute tests going forward.
